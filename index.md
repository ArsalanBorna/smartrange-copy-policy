# SmartRange Copy – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 2025_

SmartRange Copy does **not collect, store, or share any personal data** from users.

## 1. Information We Collect
The extension does **not** collect:
- Personal data  
- Text you select  
- Images, videos, or copied content  
- Browsing history  
- IP address or device information  
- Analytics or tracking data  

## 2. How SmartRange Copy Works
SmartRange Copy operates **locally on your device**.  
All actions (copying text, selecting ranges, copying media if enabled) run **only inside your browser**.

No information is ever:
- Sent to external servers  
- Shared with third parties  
- Logged or stored  

## 3. Permissions Explanation
- `storage`: Used only to save your settings (auto-copy, allow media copy).  
- `scripting`: Used to apply selection and copy logic inside pages.  
- Host permissions (`<all_urls>`): Needed so the extension can detect your ALT-clicks and perform the selection on any website.  
None of these permissions transmit data externally.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension uses **no third-party services, analytics, or tracking**.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
SmartRange Copy collects no data and is safe for all ages.
